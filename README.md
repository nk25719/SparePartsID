## Agent Tasks
1. Data Ingestion	Extract part numbers, names, specs, and compatibility info from datasheets, manuals, images, and emails.
2. Image Analysis	Use vision models to identify parts from photos or match them to a database.
3. NLP Search	Allow users to type “I need the connector used with XYZ ventilator” → Agent searches and suggests the correct part.
4. Data Entry	Auto-fill forms or ERP fields (e.g., part #, supplier, stock, usage, alternatives).

6. Integration	Connect to tools like Firebase, Notion, Google Sheets, or inventory platforms to sync changes.
